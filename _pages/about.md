Hello! I'm Luis, a dedicated engineer with a deep interest in mathematics, control theory, and machine learning. 

Currently, I'm completing my dual PhD journey at Università degli Studi dell'Aquila in Italy and Centro de Investigación y de Estudios Avanzados del IPN in Mexico. I've always been drawn to the potentials of AI, robotics, and motor drives, and strive to use innovative technology to optimize these systems.
